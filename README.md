### Overview
I am a 1st-year PhD student in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of FLorida. My research focuses on marine chemical ecology, where I study the biosynthetic gene clusters and regulatory networks responsible for natural product metabolism. 
### Computational Work
As part of my research, I utilize a variety of tools to assist with data generation and analysis. Current interests include protein binding, protein folding, directed evolution, phylogenetics, and gene network analyses.
